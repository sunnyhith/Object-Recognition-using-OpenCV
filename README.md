# Object-Recognition-using-OpenCV
Libraries - OpenCV | Programming Language - C++ | IDE - Microsoft Visual Studio

Developed an application using OpenCV libraries (Open-source Computer Vision) that takes an image as an input from the user and identifies the object in it based on the features and characteristics.

SURF Algorithm: (OpenCV Doc - https://bit.ly/2SDPsL5)
Speeded-Up Robust Features is used for finding Keypoints and Descriptors in an image.

Brute-Force Matcher: (OpenCV Doc - https://bit.ly/2FS24EV)
One of the simplest Feature Matchers. It takes the descriptor of one feature in first set and is matched with all other features in second set using a distance calculation, Hamming Distance.
The match which is the closest is returned.
